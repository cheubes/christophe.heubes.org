description: Christophe Heubès - Technical Drawing ENSAM 1939/2020
introduction:
  During his studies at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_et_M%C3%A9tiers_ParisTech" target="_blank">ENAMP <i>(École Nationale des Arts et Métiers de Paris)</i></a> between 1939 and 1942, my grandfather Claude Heubès produced about forty technical drawings in ink on tracing paper.
  In 2020, I undertook to reproduce some of them digitally.
